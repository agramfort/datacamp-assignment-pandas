# Assignment 2 for the DataCamp course X-DataScience Master - pandas

## What we want you to learn by doing this assignment:

  - Use Git and GitHub
  - Work with Python files (and not just notebooks!)
  - Do a pull request on a GitHub repository
  - Format your code properly using standard Python conventions
  - Make your code pass tests run automatically on a continuous integration system (GitHub actions)

## How?

  - Fork the repository by clicking on the `Fork` button on the upper right corner
  - Clone the repository of your fork with: `git clone https://github.com/MYLOGIN/datacamp-assignment-pandas` (replace MYLOGIN with your GitHub login)
  - Create a branch called `MYLOGIN` using `git checkout -b MYLOGIN`
  - Make the changes to complete the assignment. You have to modify the files that contain `questions` in their name. Do not modify the files that start with `test_`.
  - Check locally that your solution meet the test by running `pytest` from the root of the repo. You may need to install `pytest` using `pip` or `conda`.
  - Check the code formating for your solution using `flake8`. You may need to install `flake8` using `pip` or `conda`.
  - Open the pull request on GitHub:
     - Create a commit with `git add -u` and `git commit -m "UP my solution"`
     - Push your branch on your fork: `git push -u origin MYLOGIN`
     - Go to your repo in your browser and click the `Open a PR` button.
  - Keep pushing to your branch until the continuous integration system is green.
  - When it is green notify the professors on Slack that your done.
